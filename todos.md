1. If we didn't settle on Ubuntu as the base image, it's possible that one Docker container will work. One direction is to explore using only one Docker container for the complete obfuscation pipeline. Another direction is to update the LLVM passes to the newer compatible version.
2. Instead of parsing Frama-C's output for value sets, write a custom Frama-C plugin that will output value sets in clean and easy-to-consume format. Or even better, perform the whole obfuscation pipeline in the plugin as a Frama-C plugin is allowed to perform code transformation.
3. Frama-C displays value analysis output in different format. Since our code is parsing the stdout output for the value set, it didn't take advantage of all the possible formats due to possible mis-parsing. It would be worth the time to understand all the possible output formats for value sets and subsequently update our code so we can identify more value sets.
4. Experiments with other source-level abstract interpretation tools (e.g., [Apron](https://github.com/antoinemine/apron), [MOPSA](https://mopsa.lip6.fr), [clam](https://github.com/seahorn/clam)) and combine their outputs with Frama-C's value analysis output.
