obfuscates single-file C source code with opaque predicates that syntactically and semantically resemble real predicates in order to prevent heuristic attacks (e.g., pattern matching) while maintaining resilience against automated attacks. 

Code will be available by the end of July, at the latest. Will try to clean up obvious code smell and documentation!
